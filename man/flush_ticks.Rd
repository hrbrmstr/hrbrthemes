\description{
A convenience function intended for basic, fixed-scale plots only (i.e. does not handle
free scales in facets).\cr
\cr
You need to pass in a ggplot2 object to this function. It can't be \code{+}'d in a chain
of geoms, coords, scales, themes, etc. It also builds the plot (but does not display
it) so if the plot takes a while (i.e. has lots of data or transforms) this will also
take a while.
