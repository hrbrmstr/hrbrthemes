\description{
Color palettes and scales based on the Flexoki color scheme, a warm and soft color system
designed by Steph Ango. Flexoki emphasizes readability and natural color harmony, making
it particularly suitable for data visualization and long-form reading. The palette includes
both light and dark variants, with each offering 8 distinct colors.

The name "Flexoki" combines "flexible" and "karaoke", reflecting its adaptable nature
and harmonious color relationships.
